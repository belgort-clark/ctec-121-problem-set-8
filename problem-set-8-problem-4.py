# Module 5 - Problem Set No. 8 - Problem 4

"""
READ ALL INFORMATION CAREFULLY AND THEN READ IT AGAIN

IMPORTANT - PROVIDE AN IPO (Inputs, Processes, and Output) AT THE TOP OF EACH PROGRAM USING COMMENTS.

- At the top of each program, including a section of comments that identifies all of the inputs, processes, and outputs for the program.
- Include comments within your code explaining what the code is doing. You don't need to comment every line.
- You must use coding techniques covered in Chapters 1, 2, 3, 5 and 7 in your solutions. Code from the internet will not be accepted.

Problem 4 - 25 Points
========================
Morse code is a code where each letter of the English alphabet, each digit, and various punctuation characters are represented by a series of dots and dashes. The table in the morse-code.png image that is part of this repository shows part of the morse code conversions. Write a program that asks the user to enter a string, and then converts that string to Morse code.

HINTS
========================
- Use a loop to iterate through the inputted string going one letter a time through it.
- Use the statement below in your code. Each element in the list represents a charecter from the sample Morse code chart provided in the problem. The first element in the list is a space.
- So the letter 'A' or 'a' is in the list at position 13 and would be morse_list[13].
- Use the string accumator pattern to concatenate all of the morese code values together and display them at the end.
- There other ways to approach this problem.
- Solutions from the internet will not be accepted and a grade of zero for the entire assignment will be entered

morse_list = [' ', '--..--', '.-.-.-', '-----','.----', '..---', '...--', '....-','.....', '-....', '--...', '---..','----.', '.-', '-...', '-.-.', '-..','.', '..-.', '--.', '....', '..', '.---','-.-', '.-..', '--', '-.', '---', '.--.','--.-', '.-.', '...', '-', '..-', '...-','.--', '-..-', '-.-', '--..']
