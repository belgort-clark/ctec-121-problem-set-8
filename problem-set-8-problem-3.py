# Module 5 - Problem Set No. 8 - Problem 3

"""
READ ALL INFORMATION CAREFULLY AND THEN READ IT AGAIN

IMPORTANT - PROVIDE AN IPO (Inputs, Processes, and Output) AT THE TOP OF EACH PROGRAM USING COMMENTS.

- At the top of each program, include a section of comments that identifies all of the inputs, processes, and outputs for the program.
- Include comments within your code explaining what the code is doing. You don't need to comment every line.
- You must use coding techniques covered in Chapters 1, 2, 3, 5 and 7 in your solutions. Code from the internet will not be accepted.

Problem 3 - 33.34 Points
========================
Write a program that asks a user to enter a series of 
single-digit numbers with nothing separating them. 
Use input() for this since we want to have a string of numbers ("12345"). 
The program should display the sum of all the single digit 
numbers in the string. For example, if the user enters 2514, 
the method should return 12, which is the sum of 2, 5, 1 and 4. 
You can use input() to get the numbers as a string and then use 
Python coding to convert them to numbers as needed.

HINTS
========================
- Iterate through each character in the string using a loop. See video in Module 5 of Canvas.
- Use a loop and use range(len(theString)) for your loop or interate through the string one character at a time
- Remember that as you iterate through the loop, the iterator value can be used to slice into the string
- Convert the string to a numeric value using int()
- Use the accumulator pattern to sum the numbers. See video in Week 2 of Canvas.
